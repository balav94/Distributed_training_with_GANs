# Distributed_training_with_GANs
This repository contains the various Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architectures, specifically Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), Spectral Normalization GAN (SNGAN), Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) used to explore distributed training using Tensorflow/Horovod.
